# **Internationalization Next.js / React**

This is a modern web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). The project is designed to provide a seamless user experience with internationalization support powered by [i18next-react](https://react.i18next.com/). Styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), it ensures responsiveness and aesthetic consistency. The project leverages [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and uses components from [shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/) for a modular and extensible design system.
